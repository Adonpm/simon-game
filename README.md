Project Overview
Simon Game is a classic memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Players are tasked with remembering and repeating increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds as they progress through the game. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test and improve memory retention, with a retro design inspired by the original Simon electronic game from the late 1970s.

Features
Interactive gameplay: The game features four colored buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow) that flash in random sequences, each associated with a unique sound.
Mobile-friendly: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices. It starts by clicking or tapping the "Play" button.
Dynamic difficulty: As the player progresses, the sequences grow longer, increasing the challenge with each level.
Sound effects: Each button press and error is accompanied by a sound to enhance gameplay.
Visual feedback: Buttons flash with animations when pressed or during errors, improving player engagement.
