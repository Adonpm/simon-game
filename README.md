# Project Overview
Simon Game is a classic memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Players are tasked with remembering and repeating increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds as they progress through the game. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test and improve memory retention, with a retro design inspired by the original Simon electronic game from the late 1970s.

## Features
Interactive gameplay: The game features four colored buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow) that flash in random sequences, each associated with a unique sound.
Mobile-friendly: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices. It starts by clicking or tapping the "Play" button.
Dynamic difficulty: As the player progresses, the sequences grow longer, increasing the challenge with each level.
Sound effects: Each button press and error is accompanied by a sound to enhance gameplay.
Visual feedback: Buttons flash with animations when pressed or during errors, improving player engagement.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: Used to structure the game's content and UI.
CSS3: Used to style the game elements, including the buttons and page layout. The game has a retro look using custom fonts and color schemes.
JavaScript (ES6): Handles the game logic, including generating sequences, checking user input, and controlling game states.
jQuery: Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, such as detecting button clicks and managing game interactions.

## How to Play
Start the game: Tap or click the "Play" button. The game will begin with a single button flash, indicating the first color in the sequence.
Watch the pattern: The game will flash a color, and your task is to memorize the sequence.
Repeat the pattern: Click or tap the buttons in the order they flashed. If you get the sequence correct, the game will add another color to the sequence.
Progress: Each time you correctly repeat the pattern, the sequence lengthens by one. The goal is to repeat increasingly long sequences.
Game Over: If you press the wrong button, the game will play a "wrong" sound, flash red, and display "Game Over" on the screen. You can restart the game by tapping the "Play" button again.
